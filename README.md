To run this code: 
pull down the code to your desired location, in that location type into the console;
 
    "ruby main_controller.rb"

This will start the program running. 

Once you have done this, open a web browser of your choice and in the search bar type;

    "localhost:4567" 

This will take you to the welcome page for the system and you can access all the functionality from there.



My brief for this project was: 

Gym
A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

MVP
The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class
Inspired By
Glofox, Pike13

Possible Extensions
Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.
